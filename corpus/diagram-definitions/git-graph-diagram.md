# GitGraph Diagrams Documentation

## Diagram Type: GitGraph

### Data Presentation Capabilities
- GitGraph diagrams are excellent for visualizing the sequence of commits and branches in a git repository.
- They can show the development process in a visual format, making it easy to track changes, branches, merges, and other git operations.

### Data Presentation Limitations
- GitGraph diagrams are not suited for showing the internal code changes or content of commits.
- They do not display non-git related data such as deployment processes or the actual runtime behavior of applications.

## Task Descriptions

### Task #1 - Detailed Description (Feature Development Flow)
#### Goal:
Create a GitGraph that details the development flow of a new feature in a software project, including branching for features, bug fixes, and their merges into the main branch.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Clearly marked branches for feature development and bug fixes with commits.
- **Labels:** Each commit should be labeled with a brief description of the change or feature.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Accurate representation of git operations like branch, merge, and checkout.
- **Completeness:** The graph should cover the entire lifecycle of the feature from branching off main to merging back.
- **Additional Notes:** Highlight key commits, such as feature completions or critical bug fixes.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 25%
- **Completeness:** 15%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary or misleading element.

### Task #2 - Semi-Detailed Description (Release Preparation)
#### Goal:
Design a GitGraph showing the preparation of a release branch from the main branch, including final commits and tagging the release.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** A main branch leading into a release branch with subsequent commits.
- **Labels:** Commit messages should clearly indicate the stabilization and preparation activities.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Proper use of tags to denote release points.
- **Completeness:** Includes all actions from branch creation to release tagging.
- **Additional Notes:** Ensure that the release tag is prominent and accurately placed.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 50%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 20%
- **Completeness:** 10%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element.

### Task #3 - Vague Description (Hotfix Implementation)
#### Goal:
Sketch a GitGraph depicting a hotfix applied to a production branch and then merged back into the main development line.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Main and production branches with a clear hotfix branch off and merge back.
- **Labels:** Label commits to indicate they are part of a hotfix process.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Correctly show the branch from production, the hotfix application, and the merge back.
- **Completeness:** Display the full hotfix cycle from start to finish.
- **Additional Notes:** Highlight the urgency or critical nature of the hotfix through commit messages or tags.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 30%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 30%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 25%
- **Completeness:** 15%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 10 points for any non-essential details.

## General Usage
- **Software Development Teams:** For planning and demonstrating branch strategies.
- **DevOps Teams:** For visualizing deployment strategies related to branching.
- **Project Managers:** To understand the flow of features and fixes throughout the development process.

### Advanced Configuration and Styling
- GitGraphs support custom commit ids, commit types, and the addition of tags to illustrate versioning or significant points.
- Branch names and ordering can be customized to reflect the actual structure used in project repositories.

### Practical Examples and Use Cases
- **Feature Branch Workflow:** Demonstrating the entire process of developing a feature in isolation and integrating it back into the main project line.
- **Git Flow:** Visualizing the standard git flow process, including the use of develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches.
- **Tagging and Releases:** Showing how releases are prepared and tagged in the repository.

This documentation format ensures that GitGraph diagrams created under these guidelines are informative, visually coherent, and effectively communicate the git workflow processes they represent.
