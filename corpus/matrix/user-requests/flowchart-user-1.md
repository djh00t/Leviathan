I need a detailed flowchart that maps out the entire onboarding process for a new employee at our company. It should include multiple decision points such as work location, role type, and department, with specific actions for each choice like tech setups for remote workers or on-site orientations. Also include feedback sessions and integration steps with the team, tailored to different job types and departments.
