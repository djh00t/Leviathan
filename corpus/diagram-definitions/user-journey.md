# User Journey Diagram Documentation

## Diagram Type: User Journey Diagram

### Data Presentation Capabilities
- User Journey Diagrams are adept at showing the sequence and flow of user interactions with a product or service over time.
- They effectively map out user actions, decisions, emotional states, and interactions from an initial contact through various touchpoints to a final action.
- The diagrams illustrate temporal phases of user experience, highlighting emotions, motivations, and the narrative of the user's interaction with the system.

### Data Presentation Limitations
- Not suitable for depicting quantitative data or statistical outputs.
- Inappropriate for representing hierarchical relationships or detailed process dependencies.
- Unable to effectively display complex data structures or the flow of data within system internals.
