Author: David Hooton

## 1. Introduction

* **Purpose:** The AI Diagram Agent aims to streamline the process of creating visual representations of information for writers, analysts, and those who need to communicate complex concepts. It solves the challenges of manually generating diagrams and the need for specialized diagramming software expertise, enabling users to easily generate clear and helpful visuals using natural language descriptions. The AI Diagram Agent reduces the time-consuming task of creating visuals, allowing users to focus on communicating their ideas.

* **Target Audience:** Technical writers, business analysts, software developers, educators, project managers (and potentially others).

## 2. Overall Description

* System Context: Briefly describe how this system fits into a larger tech ecosystem (if applicable).
* Assumptions: State any factors you're assuming to be true for this project (e.g., "Users have a basic understanding of diagramming concepts").

## 3. Specific Requirements

### Functional Requirements

* **FR 1: Input Types**
    * The system shall accept textual descriptions of diagrams as input.
    * The system shall support the upload of data in CSV, DOCX, XLSX, and TXT formats.  **[Open Question: Example file structures needed]**

* **FR 2: Supported Diagram Types**
    * The system shall generate the following types of diagrams from user input:
        * Flowchart
        * Sequence Diagram
        * State Diagram
        * Entity Relationship Diagram
        * User Journey
        * Pie Chart
        * Requirement Diagram
        * Mindmap

* **FR 3: Diagram Generation**
    * The system shall convert user input (textual description or uploaded file) into the selected diagram type using the Mermaid.js library (or a suitable alternative).

* **FR 4: Output Formats**
    * The system shall provide the generated diagrams in the following formats:
        * Mermaid markdown code
        * SVG
        * PNG
        * PDF

* **FR 5: Customization** (For Later Consideration)
    * The system shall allow users to customize the visual style (colors, fonts, etc.) of the generated diagrams.  **[Deferred]**

* **FR 6: Interactivity** (For Later Consideration)
    * The system shall allow for basic interactivity features within the generated diagrams (e.g., click to zoom, tooltips).  **[Deferred]**

Important Considerations

* Prioritize: Rank requirements using a system like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
* Specificity: Be as precise as possible (e.g., instead of "fast", quantify with a response time goal).
* Collaborate: If you're working with a team, get everyone's input to ensure the requirements are complete and understood by all.
