# NLP Task Description

### Diagram Type: State Diagram
### Task: User Authentication State Machine
This task involves creating a state diagram to visualize the various states and transitions involved in the user authentication process, helping stakeholders understand the flow of authentication states and transitions.

## Data
### Explicit Data Description
The state diagram will represent the user authentication process with the following states and transitions: Starting from an 'Idle' state, a 'UserInitiatesLogin' event transitions the system to 'Authenticating'. From 'Authenticating', the system can either transition to 'LoggedIn' upon 'AuthenticationSuccess' or return to 'Idle' on 'AuthenticationFailure'. From 'LoggedIn', a 'UserInitiatesLogout' event will transition the system back to 'Idle'.

### Raw Data

```csv
State,Event,NextState
Idle,UserInitiatesLogin,Authenticating
Authenticating,AuthenticationSuccess,LoggedIn
Authenticating,AuthenticationFailure,Idle
LoggedIn,UserInitiatesLogout,Idle
```

## Validation & Scoring Criteria

### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** The state diagram should illustrate the various states and transitions involved in the user authentication process, including initial, intermediate, and final states.
- **Labels:** Each state and transition should be labeled clearly to indicate the state name, event triggering the transition, and the next state.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** The state transitions should accurately represent the actual flow of the user authentication process.
- **Completeness:** All significant states and transitions should be included
  in the diagram, covering both successful and failed authentication scenarios.
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each component or connection listed
  in the raw data that does not appear in the generated diagram.
- **Additional Notes:** The diagram should be easy to follow and should highlight any potential error states or exceptional scenarios in the authentication process.

**Mermaid Example:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Authenticating: UserInitiatesLogin
    Authenticating --> LoggedIn: AuthenticationSuccess
    Authenticating --> Idle: AuthenticationFailure
    LoggedIn --> Idle: UserInitiatesLogout
```

### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
- **Completeness:** 10%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element.
