# NLP Task Description

### Diagram Type: Magic Quadrant
### Task: Reach and Engagement Analysis of Marketing Campaigns
This task involves creating a Magic Quadrant to evaluate various marketing campaigns based on their reach and engagement. This tool helps marketing teams to prioritize resources and strategies for different campaigns.

## Data
### Explicit Data Description
The Magic Quadrant will plot marketing campaigns on a graph with two axes: 'Reach' on the x-axis and 'Engagement' on the y-axis. Detailed examples for each campaign include:
1. **Campaign A** - Reach: 0.3, Engagement: 0.6
2. **Campaign B** - Reach: 0.45, Engagement: 0.23
3. **Campaign C** - Reach: 0.57, Engagement: 0.69
4. **Campaign D** - Reach: 0.78, Engagement: 0.34
5. **Campaign E** - Reach: 0.40, Engagement: 0.34
6. **Campaign F** - Reach: 0.35, Engagement: 0.78
Campaigns will be categorized into one of four quadrants: "We should expand," "Need to promote," "Re-evaluate," or "May be improved" based on their scores in these dimensions.

### Raw Data

```csv
Campaign,Reach,Engagement
Campaign A,0.3,0.6

Campaign F,0.35,0.78
```
