# Gantt Chart Documentation

## Diagram Type: Gantt Chart

### Data Presentation Capabilities
- Ideal for displaying project schedules, including start and end dates for tasks.
- Shows dependencies between tasks, visually indicating prerequisite tasks.
- Tracks the progress of tasks, often illustrated with different shading or colors to indicate the percentage of work completed.

### Data Presentation Limitations
- Not suited for presenting non-temporal data such as categorical comparisons or hierarchical structures.
- Cannot effectively display detailed data that is not related to timelines or sequences of events.
- Inappropriate for high-level qualitative data like user sentiments or preferences.

## Task Descriptions

### Task #1 - Detailed Gantt Chart

#### Goal
Create a Gantt chart for the development of a new software feature, detailing the phases of design, implementation, testing, and deployment over a six-month period.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Sequential timeline with clear phase demarcations.
* **Labels:** Each phase (Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment) clearly labeled with start and end dates.
* **Semantic Accuracy:** Correct representation of dependencies and task durations.
* **Completeness:** Chart must include all phases with correct timeline allocation.
* **Additional Notes:** Highlight progress tracking through partial shading for phases as they advance.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 40%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element included.

### Task #2 - Semi-Detailed Gantt Chart

#### Goal
Outline a Gantt chart for an office move planned over three months, segmenting into preparation, moving, and settling in phases.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Timeline divided into three distinct phases.
* **Labels:** Each phase labeled with precise start and end dates.
* **Semantic Accuracy:** Accurate depiction of sequential dependencies among phases.
* **Completeness:** Complete representation including all planning phases.
* **Additional Notes:** Emphasize the dependency lines to clarify the sequence of operations.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 50%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 20%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points per extraneous element.

### Task #3 - Vague Gantt Chart

#### Goal
Develop a Gantt chart for a school year planning from September to June, vaguely outlining major events like semesters, holidays, and exams.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Broad overview of the school year with major events.
* **Labels:** General labels such as 'Semesters', 'Holidays', 'Exams' with approximate timeframes.
* **Semantic Accuracy:** General representation without specific start and end dates for events.
* **Completeness:** Include all major timeframes and events as described.
* **Additional Notes:** Focus on the clarity of major time divisions and their purpose within the school year.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 30%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 30%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for any non-essential components.
