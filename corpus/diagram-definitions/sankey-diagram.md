# Sankey Diagrams Documentation

## Diagram Type: Sankey Diagram

### Data Presentation Capabilities
- Sankey diagrams are used to depict flows and their quantities in proportion to one another. They show how quantities flow from one set of values to another over the network.
- Commonly used for visualizing energy budgets, material flows, traffic flows, or financial transactions.

### Data Presentation Limitations
- Not suitable for depicting non-flow related data such as hierarchical data or non-quantitative relationships.
- Can become cluttered and hard to read with too many nodes or complex networks.

## Task Descriptions

### Task #1 - Detailed Description (Energy Flow in an Ecosystem)
#### Goal:
Create a detailed Sankey diagram to illustrate the flow of energy in an ecosystem, from primary producers up through various trophic levels.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Clear and logical progression from primary producers to apex predators, including intermediate levels.
- **Labels:** Each flow labeled with the amount of energy transferred, and each node labeled with the organism type.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Correctly represents the conservation of energy principle and the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels.
- **Completeness:** Includes all significant energy transfers within the ecosystem.
- **Additional Notes:** Use varying widths for flows to visually represent the proportionate energy transfer.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 30%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
- **Completeness:** 20%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element.

### Task #2 - Semi-Detailed Description (Manufacturing Process)
#### Goal:
Design a semi-detailed Sankey diagram to show material flow through different stages of a manufacturing process.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Sequential flow from raw materials to finished products, including intermediate stages.
- **Labels:** Each node and flow accurately labeled with material names and quantities.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Correct depiction of the mass balance, with inputs and outputs matching.
- **Completeness:** All major stages and material flows should be included.
- **Additional Notes:** Highlight any stages where significant losses occur.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 15%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 25%
- **Completeness:** 20%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for any irrelevant details.

### Task #3 - Vague Description (Budget Allocation)
#### Goal:
Sketch a basic Sankey diagram to visualize how a department's budget is allocated to various projects.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Simple flow from the total budget to different projects.
- **Labels:** Label each flow with the amount of money allocated.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Ensure that the total budget matches the sum of all allocations.
- **Completeness:** Cover key projects that significantly impact the budget.
- **Additional Notes:** Use color coding to differentiate between project types.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 25%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 25%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 25%
- **Completeness:** 25%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 10 points for any non-essential components.

## General Usage
- **Environmental Science:** For depicting energy flows in ecological systems.
- **Industrial Engineering:** To visualize material usage and losses in manufacturing processes.
- **Financial Planning:** For illustrating how funds are distributed within organizations.

### Advanced Configuration and Styling
- Sankey diagrams can be customized with different colors for links, adjustable node positions, and specific settings for flow width to represent the volume of flow more accurately.

### Practical Examples and Use Cases
- **Energy Distribution:** Visualizing how energy is distributed and used within a power grid.
- **Supply Chain Analysis:** Tracking the flow of goods through supply chains to identify bottlenecks.
- **Cost Tracking:** Demonstrating how costs accumulate through different phases of a project or service.

This documentation provides a clear framework for creating and evaluating Sankey Diagrams, ensuring that they effectively communicate the flow and distribution of quantities in various contexts.
