# Quadrant Chart Diagrams Documentation

## Diagram Type: Quadrant Chart

### Data Presentation Capabilities
- Quadrant charts are used to visually represent data across four quadrants on a two-dimensional grid, where each quadrant reflects a unique combination of two variables represented on the x-axis and y-axis.
- These charts are excellent for categorizing data points based on differing criteria, aiding in decision-making processes by highlighting how elements compare in terms of urgency, importance, performance, etc.

### Data Presentation Limitations
- Not suitable for displaying data that requires more than two dimensions of analysis or where the relationship between more than two variables needs to be shown.
- Less effective when dealing with a large number of data points as it can lead to cluttered and hard-to-read visuals.

### Task #3 - Vague Description (Team Performance Review)
#### Goal:
Sketch a basic quadrant chart to assess team performance based on efficiency and effectiveness.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Four quadrants showing combinations of high and low efficiency against high and low effectiveness.
- **Labels:** Appropriate labels for each quadrant and axis.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Ensure the team or individual performance markers are placed in the correct quadrants.
- **Completeness:** All relevant teams or individuals should be assessed and included.
- **Additional Notes:** Utilize color coding to represent different departments or teams.
#### Scoring Weights:
