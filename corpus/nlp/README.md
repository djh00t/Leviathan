The NLP corpus is a work in progress and contains training data for the NLP model in this project. This corpus is designed to enhance the model's understanding and processing capabilities by providing a diverse set of data examples. Below is an overview of each directory within the corpus and their specific purposes:

1. **Training Data**: This directory contains datasets that are used to train the NLP model. These datasets include various types of text data that help the model learn different aspects of language processing.

2. **Validation Data**: Contains data used to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the NLP model during the training process. This helps in tuning the model parameters appropriately.

3. **Test Data**: This directory includes data that is used to test the NLP model after training and validation. It helps in assessing the model's performance and its ability to generalize over unseen data.

4. **Supplementary Data**: Includes additional data that can be used for further training or refinement of the model. This might include specialized datasets that focus on particular linguistic features or domains.

5. **Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation on the data formats, data sources, and methodologies used in preparing the NLP corpus. This is crucial for understanding the structure and the purpose of the data included.
