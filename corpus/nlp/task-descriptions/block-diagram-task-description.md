# NLP Task Description

### Diagram Type: Block Diagram

### Task: Hardware Component Visualization

This task involves creating a block diagram, as shown in the Mermaid example, to visually represent major
hardware components, including CPU, RAM, Storage, Network Interface Cards (NICs), and connections to the network and systems.

## Data

### Explicit Data Description

The block diagram will depict major hardware components such as CPU, RAM,
Storage, Network Interface Cards (NICs), and connections to the network and
systems. Note that the raw data example may not be a complete list of all
possible components. Each block represents a component, and lines show
connectivity and data flow.

### Raw Data

```csv
Component,Connections
RAM,"CPU"
CPU,"RAM, STORAGE, NIC"
STORAGE,"CPU"
NIC,"CPU, DB"
DB,"NIC"
```

## Validation & Scoring Criteria

### Expected Result:

- **Structure:** A block diagram illustrating major hardware components and their connections.
- **Labels:** Components labeled appropriately, and connections between components clearly represented.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Correct representation of component connectivity based on the raw data.
- **Completeness:** All major hardware components and connections should be included in the diagram.
- **Additional Notes:** The diagram should provide a clear overview of the hardware architecture and data flow.

**Mermaid Example:**

```mermaid

%%{init: {'theme': 'base'}}%%
block-beta
    columns 1
    block:CORE
        RAM
        STORAGE
    end
    space
    RAM ---> CPU
    CPU ---> RAM
    STORAGE ---> CPU
    CPU ---> STORAGE
    CPU
    space
    NIC["Network Card"]
    NIC --> CPU
    CPU --> NIC
    space
    block:NETWORK["\nNetwork"]
        columns 3
        space
        DB(("DB"))
        space
        space
        space
        space
    end
    DB --> NIC

```

### Scoring Weights:

- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
- **Completeness:** 10%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each component or connection listed
  in the raw data that does not appear in the generated diagram.
- **Additional Notes:**
