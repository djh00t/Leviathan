# NLP Task Description

### Diagram Type: C4 Model Diagram
### Task: Software System Architecture
This task involves creating a C4 Model Diagram to represent the software architecture of a typical online shopping system. This model will outline the software components, their relationships, and interactions with external systems.

## Data
### Explicit Data Description
The C4 Model will include four levels of abstraction: Context, Containers, Components, and Code. The Context diagram will show the overall system and its interactions with users and external systems. The Container diagram will break down the system into web applications, databases, and services. The Component diagram will delve deeper into the architecture of a specific container, like the web application. The Code level will illustrate some specific classes or code structures.

### Raw Data

```csv
Level,Description
Context,"System, Users, External Interfaces"
Container,"Web App, Mobile App, Database, API Services"
Component,"Shopping Cart, User Profile, Payment Interface"
Code,"Classes and Methods for Payment Processing"
```

## Validation & Scoring Criteria

### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** The diagram should clearly depict the different abstraction layers of the system.
- **Labels:** Each element within the layers should be appropriately labeled with its role or function.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** The relationships and data flows between the elements must correctly represent the actual software architecture.
- **Completeness:** The diagram should cover all principal components and their
  interactions within the system.
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each component or connection listed
  in the raw data that does not appear in the generated diagram.
- **Additional Notes:**
- **Additional Notes:** Use color coding or different shapes to distinguish between different types of elements (e.g., databases, services, user interfaces).

**Mermaid Example:**

```mermaid
C4Dynamic
    title Dynamic diagram for Online Shopping System

    ContainerDb(database, "Database", "Stores user and product information.")
    Container(webApp, "Web Application", "Serves the online shopping interface to customers.")
    Container_Boundary(apiApp, "API Application") {
        Component(securityComponent, "Security Component", "Handles security protocols")
        Component(signInController, "Sign In Controller", "Manages user sign-in processes")
    }
    Rel(webApp, signInController, "Submits credentials to", "JSON/HTTPS")
    Rel(signInController, securityComponent, "Validates credentials")
    Rel(securityComponent, database, "Queries user data", "SQL")

    UpdateRelStyle(webApp, signInController, $textColor="red", $offsetY="-40")
    UpdateRelStyle(signInController, securityComponent, $textColor="red", $offsetX="-40", $offsetY="60")
    UpdateRelStyle(securityComponent, database, $textColor="red", $offsetY="-40", $offsetX="10")
```

### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
- **Completeness:** 10%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element.
