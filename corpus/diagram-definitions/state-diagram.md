# State Diagram Documentation

## Diagram Type: State Diagram

### Suitable Data Types for State Diagram
- System behaviors and state changes based on events.
- Workflow processes where states change based on actions or conditions.
- Life cycles of objects where the state reflects different phases of existence.
- Suitable for modeling the state changes in a system or an object over time, reflecting different states and transitions based on events.

### Unsuitable Data Types for State Diagram
- Not suitable for illustrating static structures like class relationships, non-temporal data, or physical layouts.
- Non-dynamic datasets without clear state changes or transitions, such as static data (e.g., demographic information).
- Hierarchical data structures, like organizational charts.
- Continuous quantitative data that does not have discrete state changes (e.g., temperature readings over time).

## Task Descriptions

### Task #1 - Detailed Description (High Precision State Diagram)

#### Description
Create a state diagram that models a simple login process for a web application, covering all relevant states and transitions from initial access to session timeout or logout.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Sequential states with clear transitions.
* **Labels:** Each state and transition must be accurately labeled with specific actions (e.g., 'Entering Credentials', 'Valid Credentials').
* **Semantic Accuracy:** Each transition must logically follow from the state based on user actions or system checks.
* **Completeness:** The diagram should cover all described states including retries and session timeouts.
* **Additional Notes:** Include detailed transitions for retry mechanisms and session management.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 40%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element included.

### Task #2 - Moderately Detailed Description (User Authentication Flow)

#### Description
Design a state diagram for an email system's user authentication process that incorporates multi-factor authentication, detailing the flow from initial login attempt to potential logout.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Clear depiction of each authentication phase.
* **Labels:** Proper labeling of each state and transition, including multi-factor steps.
* **Semantic Accuracy:** Accurately depict the authentication logic, particularly the handling of incorrect credentials and multi-factor confirmation.
* **Completeness:** Diagram must include all authentication steps and possible outcomes.
* **Additional Notes:** Emphasize error handling and the retry limit in the authentication process.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 50%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 20%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points per extraneous element.

### Task #3 - Vague Description (Simple Sign-in Process)

#### Description
Construct a state diagram for a basic user sign-in process, from the initial access to successful login, including error handling for incorrect password entries.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Basic sequential flow from start to successful login.
* **Labels:** General labels for stages like 'Start', 'Input Details', 'Error Handling', 'Logged In'.
* **Semantic Accuracy:** Should clearly depict the flow and possible loops back for error correction.
* **Completeness:** While details are vague, include key states and transitions to represent the sign-in process fully.
* **Additional Notes:** Focus on the user journey, particularly how errors are managed and corrected.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 30%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 30%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for any non-essential components.
