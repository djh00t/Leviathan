# Requirement Diagrams Documentation

## Diagram Type: Requirement Diagram

### Data Presentation Capabilities
- Requirement diagrams visualize requirements and their relationships, including dependencies and derivations, to support system design and verification processes.
- These diagrams are essential in systems engineering, using a methodology aligned with SysML to help in planning, verifying, and implementing system requirements.

### Data Presentation Limitations
- Not suitable for displaying dynamic behaviors or real-time interactions between system components.
- Can become complex and hard to interpret if not properly organized, especially with a large number of requirements.

## Task Descriptions

### Task #1 - Detailed Description (Complete System Requirements)
#### Goal:
Create a comprehensive requirement diagram for a new software application, detailing all functional, performance, and interface requirements.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Clearly defined hierarchy of requirements including parent-child relationships.
- **Labels:** Each requirement must be labeled with its type, ID, description, associated risk, and verification method.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Accurately represent the dependencies and relationships between requirements.
- **Completeness:** Include all types of requirements necessary for the systemâ€™s functionality.
- **Additional Notes:** Use different colors or styles for different types of requirements to enhance readability.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 30%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
- **Completeness:** 20%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element.

### Task #2 - Semi-Detailed Description (Subsystem Requirement Analysis)
#### Goal:
Design a requirement diagram for a subsystem within a larger project, focusing on interface and performance requirements.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Diagram should clearly show the subsystem's requirements and how they connect to the broader system requirements.
- **Labels:** Proper labeling of each requirement with its ID, risk level, and verification method.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Ensure the logical connection of subsystem requirements to overall system objectives.
- **Completeness:** Diagram must include all critical subsystem requirements.
- **Additional Notes:** Highlight any high-risk requirements and their mitigation strategies.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 15%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 25%
- **Completeness:** 20%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for any irrelevant details.

### Task #3 - Vague Description (Basic Requirement Mapping)
#### Goal:
Sketch a basic requirement diagram for a small project or feature, identifying key requirements and their verification methods.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Simple diagram showing main requirements without detailed sub-requirements.
- **Labels:** Each requirement should have a basic ID and text description.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Correctly show basic relationships like satisfies or derives.
- **Completeness:** Cover essential requirements needed for the feature to function.
- **Additional Notes:** Use straightforward layouts to maintain clarity.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 25%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 25%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 25%
- **Completeness:** 25%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 10 points for any non-essential components.

## General Usage
- **Systems Engineering:** For modeling and managing system requirements.
- **Project Management:** To ensure all project specifications are met and traceable.
- **Quality Assurance:** For verifying that all system requirements are testable and meet necessary standards.

### Advanced Configuration and Styling
- Requirement diagrams in Mermaid can be customized with various layout options, styles, and colors to distinguish between different types of information effectively.

### Practical Examples and Use Cases
- **Large Scale Systems:** Detailing requirements for complex systems such as aerospace or automotive systems.
- **Software Development:** Mapping out software feature requirements and their dependencies.
- **Compliance and Standards:** Ensuring all system designs meet regulatory and safety standards through clear requirement tracking.

This documentation provides a clear framework for creating and evaluating Requirement Diagrams, ensuring they effectively communicate the necessary details about system requirements and their interrelations.
