# Pie Chart Diagrams Documentation

## Diagram Type: Pie Chart

### Data Presentation Capabilities
- Pie charts are circular statistical graphics divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions.
- Useful for displaying simple proportional data from a dataset, showing the size of categories relative to each other in a clear and intuitive manner.

### Data Presentation Limitations
- Not suitable for displaying complex data sets with many categories or when precision is required, as small differences can be hard to discern.
- Ineffective for comparing across multiple data sets. Bar charts or line graphs might be more appropriate in those cases.

## Task Descriptions

### Task #1 - Detailed Description (Company Revenue Breakdown)
#### Goal:
Create a detailed pie chart to display the breakdown of company revenue by
product category for the fiscal year.

#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Each slice represents a different product category.
- **Labels:** Slices should be labeled with the category name and the percentage of total revenue it represents.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Each slice's size should accurately reflect its proportion of the total revenue.
- **Completeness:** All major product categories should be included in the chart.
- **Additional Notes:** Use distinct colors for each slice to enhance readability and differentiation.

#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
- **Completeness:** 10%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element.

### Task #2 - Semi-Detailed Description (Market Share Distribution)
#### Goal:
Design a semi-detailed pie chart to illustrate the market share distribution among leading competitors in the industry.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Pie chart with slices for each competitor.
- **Labels:** Each slice labeled with the competitor's name and their market share percentage.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Proportions should accurately reflect the market data.
- **Completeness:** Include all significant competitors in the market.
- **Additional Notes:** Consider using a legend if the pie chart becomes cluttered.
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 50%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 20%
- **Completeness:** 10%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for any irrelevant details.

### Task #3 - Vague Description (Survey Results Visualization)
#### Goal:
Sketch a basic pie chart to visualize the results of a customer satisfaction survey categorizing responses into satisfied, neutral, and dissatisfied.
#### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** Three slices representing each category of response.
- **Labels:** Label each slice with the response category and the percentage of total responses.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Ensure the slice sizes reflect the survey results accurately.
- **Completeness:** All response categories should be represented.
- **Additional Notes:** Use intuitive color coding (e.g., green for satisfied, yellow for neutral, red for dissatisfied).
#### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 30%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 30%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 25%
- **Completeness:** 15%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 10 points for any non-essential components.

## General Usage
- **Business Analysis:** For showcasing simple proportions like market share or revenue distribution.
- **Education:** Helping students understand fractions, percentages, and basic data interpretation.
- **Presentations:** To communicate quick insights into data distributions and proportions in a visually appealing format.

### Advanced Configuration and Styling
- Pie charts in Mermaid can be customized with various settings such as `textPosition` to adjust the label positioning, making the data easier to read and more visually appealing.

### Practical Examples and Use Cases
- **Financial Overview:** Visualizing different sectors contributing to a company's revenue.
- **Survey Data Reporting:** Displaying public opinion or customer feedback in marketing studies.
- **Resource Allocation:** Showing how different departments or projects utilize resources in an organization.

This documentation provides a clear framework for creating and evaluating Pie Chart diagrams, ensuring that they effectively communicate the proportional relationships within a dataset.
