# Flowchart Diagram Documentation

## Diagram Type: Flowchart

### Data Presentation Capabilities
- Suitable for presenting sequential processes, decision trees, or workflows.

### Data Presentation Limitations
- Not suitable for representing non-sequential data such as correlations, hierarchical data, or multidimensional data.

## Task Descriptions

### Task #1: Detailed Flowchart for Software Development Lifecycle

#### Description
Create a flowchart that details the steps of a software development lifecycle (SDLC). Start with 'Requirement Gathering', then move to 'Design', followed by 'Implementation', 'Testing', and 'Maintenance'. Include decision points after 'Testing' to decide if more development is needed based on the results.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Sequential process with decision points.
* **Labels:** "Requirement Gathering", "Design", "Implementation", "Testing", "Decision (Pass?)", "Maintenance", "End"
* **Semantic Accuracy:** Diagram should include a feedback loop from 'Testing' back to 'Design' if tests fail.
* **Completeness:** Must cover all mentioned stages in the description.
* **Additional Notes:** Ensure the flowchart correctly reflects the cyclical nature of the SDLC, especially in handling post-testing decisions.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 50%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 20%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** -5 points per extraneous element

### Task #2: Customer Service Process

#### Description
Design a flowchart for a typical customer service process. Begin with 'Customer Calls', followed by 'Query Categorized', leading to either 'Technical Support', 'Billing', or 'General Inquiry'. Each of these paths should end at 'Resolve Issue' and then 'End Call'.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Branching process with end points.
* **Labels:** "Customer Calls", "Query Categorized", "Technical Support", "Billing", "General Inquiry", "Resolve Issue", "End Call"
* **Semantic Accuracy:** Must correctly categorize queries into distinct paths leading to resolution.
* **Completeness:** All branches from the categorization point to the end of the call should be represented.
* **Additional Notes:** Special attention to ensuring that each branch is logically and visually distinct to avoid confusion.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 40%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** -5 points per extraneous element

### Task #3: Simple Login Process

#### Description
Sketch a simple flowchart for a login process. Begin with 'Enter Username and Password', followed by a decision 'Is Information Correct?'. If yes, proceed to 'Login Successful', otherwise go to 'Retry'.

#### Expected Result

* **Structure:** Linear process with a decision node.
* **Labels:** "Enter Username and Password", "Is Information Correct?", "Login Successful", "Retry"
* **Semantic Accuracy:** Accurately represent the decision-making process of user validation.
* **Completeness:** Must depict all steps from user input to either successful login or retry.
* **Additional Notes:** The decision node is critical and should be clearly identifiable with correct routing for both outcomes.

#### Scoring Weights

* **Component Matching:** 40%
* **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
* **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
* **Completeness:** 10%
* **Extra Elements:** -5 points per extraneous element
