# NLP Task Description

### Diagram Type: Entity Relationship Diagram
### Task: University Database Schema
This task involves creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a university's database system. The diagram will represent the entities, their attributes, and relationships such as student enrollment, faculty, courses, and departments.

## Data
### Explicit Data Description
The ERD will include entities like Student, Course, Faculty, Department, and Enrollment. Key relationships will include Students enrolled in Courses, Faculty teaching Courses, and Courses offered by Departments. Each entity will have relevant attributes like Student (StudentID, Name, Major) and Course (CourseID, Name, Credits).

### Raw Data

```csv
Entity,Attributes,Relationships
Student,"StudentID, Name, Major","Enrolled in Courses"
Course,"CourseID, Name, Credits","Taught by Faculty, Offered by Department"
Faculty,"FacultyID, Name, Department","Teaches Courses"
Department,"DepartmentID, Name","Offers Courses"
Enrollment,"StudentID, CourseID","Links Students and Courses"
```

## Validation & Scoring Criteria

### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** The diagram should clearly depict all entities and their relationships.
- **Labels:** Each entity should be labeled with its name and list of attributes.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** The relationships between entities should accurately reflect the administrative and academic structure of the university.
- **Completeness:** The diagram should include all primary entities and their relationships necessary for the university's database.
- **Additional Notes:** Use standardized ERD notation to ensure clarity and adherence to database design principles.

**Mermaid Example:**

```mermaid
erDiagram
    STUDENT ||--o{ ENROLLMENT : "enrolled in"
    COURSE ||--o{ ENROLLMENT : "has"
    COURSE ||--|| FACULTY : "taught by"
    DEPARTMENT ||--o{ COURSE : "offers"
    FACULTY ||--|| DEPARTMENT : "belongs to"
```

### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
- **Completeness:** 10%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element.
