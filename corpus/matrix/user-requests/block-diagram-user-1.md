I need a comprehensive block diagram that illustrates the full architecture of our enterprise system. Include all user types, multiple layers of servers including web, application, and database clusters, microservices, security systems, integration with external APIs, and DevOps tools. Also, make sure to show the flow between different components like message brokers and middleware.
