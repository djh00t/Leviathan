# NLP Task Description

### Diagram Type: Gantt Chart
### Task: New Product Launch Plan
This task involves creating a Gantt Chart for the project management of a new product launch. The chart will display the timeline for all key activities, from initial market research to the official product release.

## Data
### Explicit Data Description
The Gantt Chart will outline major tasks such as Market Research, Product Design, Prototyping, Testing, Marketing, and Launch. Each task will be associated with start dates, end dates, and dependencies, showing the sequence and overlap of activities.

### Raw Data

## Validation & Scoring Criteria

### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** The chart should clearly illustrate the timeline and sequence of project tasks.
- **Labels:** Each task should be labeled with its name and the duration it covers.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** The dependencies and overlaps between tasks should be correctly represented to reflect true project dynamics.
- **Completeness:** The chart should include all significant tasks required to
  bring the product from concept to market.
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each component or connection listed
  in the raw data that does not appear in the generated diagram.
- **Additional Notes:** Use contrasting colors for different task phases to enhance readability and enable quick visual assessment of project status.
