# NLP Task Description

### Diagram Type: Requirements Diagram
### Task: Software Requirements Specification for a Smart Home System
This task involves creating a Requirements Diagram to visually represent and organize the requirements of a smart home system. The diagram will help in defining the necessary functionalities, security measures, and interactions within the system, guiding both development and testing efforts.

## Data
### Explicit Data Description
Imagine we're setting up a smart home system. Here's what we need to make sure everything works smoothly and safely:
1. **User Authentication**: This is crucial. It's the first thing we check to make sure only authorized users can access the system. We'll test this thoroughly because it's a high-risk area.
2. **Device Connectivity**: Once we know a user is authorized, we need to connect their devices. This is also tested and has a medium risk because it relies on the authentication step.
3. **Data Privacy**: Protecting user data is non-negotiable. We test this rigorously because it's a high-risk area, especially right after we verify who's using the system.
4. **Energy Efficiency**: We also look at how the system manages power. It's reviewed for medium risk. Efficient power use helps everything run smoothly and depends on how well the devices connect.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Finally, we make sure everything complies with the law. This is high risk and reviewed carefully to ensure we meet all legal standards.

## Validation & Scoring Criteria

### Expected Result:
- **Structure:** The diagram should clearly display all requirements along with their categorization.
- **Labels:** Each requirement should be clearly labeled with its ID, type, and a brief description.
- **Semantic Accuracy:** The dependencies between requirements and system elements should accurately reflect the design and operational constraints.
- **Completeness:** The diagram should encompass all critical requirements for
  the smart home system.
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each component or connection listed
  in the raw data that does not appear in the generated diagram.
- **Additional Notes:** Use icons or different colors to differentiate between types of requirements (e.g., functional, security).

**Mermaid Example:**

    requirement test_req {
        id: 1
        text: "the test text."
        risk: high
        verifymethod: test
    }
    functionalRequirement test_req2 {
        id: 1.1
        text: "the second test text."
        risk: low
        verifymethod: inspection
    }
    performanceRequirement test_req3 {
        id: 1.2
        text: "the third test text."
        risk: medium
        verifymethod: demonstration
    }
    interfaceRequirement test_req4 {
        id: 1.2.1
        text: "the fourth test text."
        risk: medium
        verifymethod: analysis
    }
    physicalRequirement test_req5 {
        id: 1.2.2
        text: "the fifth test text."
        risk: medium
        verifymethod: analysis
    }
    designConstraint test_req6 {
        id: 1.2.3
        text: "the sixth test text."
        risk: medium
        verifymethod: analysis
    }
    element test_entity {
        type: simulation
    }
    element test_entity2 {
        type: word doc
        docRef: reqs/test_entity
    }
    element test_entity3 {
        type: "test suite"
        docRef: github.com/all_the_tests
    }

    test_entity - satisfies -> test_req2
    test_req - traces -> test_req2
    test_req - contains -> test_req3
    test_req3 - contains -> test_req4
    test_req4 - derives -> test_req5
    test_req5 - refines -> test_req6
    test_entity3 - verifies -> test_req5
    test_req <- copies - test_entity2

### Scoring Weights:
- **Component Matching:** 40%
- **Syntax Correctness:** 20%
- **Semantic Accuracy:** 30%
- **Completeness:** 10%
- **Extra Elements:** Deduct 5 points for each unnecessary element.
